## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
This project is a calculator that takes info from client side and solves it server side. The biggest problem i ran into with this project was getting the operator to work in terms of math. to solve this problem i used a switch statement to match the operator with the correct equation. Then substituting variables "A" and "B" to output the correct solution.
